- **Confidentiality**: We will maintain confidentiality to the extent possible, sharing information only with those who need to know.
- **Resolution**: We will communicate the outcome of the investigation to the reporter and take appropriate action based on the findings.

We will also notify you when the issue is resolved and acknowledge your contribution in the release notes unless you choose to opt-out.
